is with joy that we present the 0.10.0 version of Ethereum Wallet and Mist Browser beta. This release brings some fundamental changes that will help shape the following versions of the project, along with some long-awaited improvements. \r\n\r\n## Light client as default sync mode\r\n\r\nAlong with the Geth 1.8 series, the Light Client sync mode got significant improvements and is fully usable again. It features a [blazingly fast](https://twitter.com/acdlite/status/974390255393505280) zero-to-latest-block speed, with little impact on storage requirements. \r\n\r\nAfter lots of testing, we have promoted the Light Client sync mode as default on Mist and Ethereum Wallet for new users. \r\n\r\nYou can toggle the sync mode on `Develop` > `Sync with Light Client`.\r\n\r\nThe Light Client sync mode was devised to request information on-demand from \"Light Servers\", thus removing the need of having the entire blockchain on a device. Those “Light Servers” also work in a secure and decentralized manner, meaning anyone could set up and run their own, conveying benefits to the whole network health. Please consider [running a Light Server](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/11014/how-to-run-a-server-for-light-clients) :)\r\n\r\n## Syncing and overall experience\r\n\r\nWe've spent quite some time simplifying the startup process. You can expect a smoother process as we’ve fixed some small bugs and annoyances. \r\n\r\n- Light Client syncing mode as the default setting\r\n- Introduces a core state module leveraging Redux \r\n- Updates to latest Geth version\r\n- Removes an outdated onboarding process \r\n- Adds \"retry connection\" to wallet splash screen \r\n- Swarm will start asynchronously, plus the ability to toggle the service\r\n\r\nWe are aware how much the syncing process takes away from the experience and while these improvements certainly help, we know there’s a lot more we can do. We are working on a “layered node” architecture in an upcoming release, which will allow us to remove the syncing screen altogether. This feature will allow you to connect directly to a remote node and use Mist/Ethereum Wallet immediately. Meanwhile, your local geth node will continue to sync in the background and will receive web3 calls once it is fully synced. Read more on [layered nodes here](https://github.com/ethereum/mist/issues/3673).\r\n\r\n## Bugfixes and behind-the-curtain improvements\r\n- Splash logic refactor, pt. 1 \r\n- Minor fix on getTransactionReceipt override\r\n- Fix for mist.es.i18n.json \r\n- Unable to create contract\r\n- Updating OS-timesync package  \r\n\r\n## Electron security updates\r\nWe’ve updated to Electron’s latest stable release, with security fixes. More info on their release notes: [1.8.4](https://github.com/electron/electron/releases/tag/v1.8.4), [1.8.3](https://github.com/electron/electron/releases/tag/v1.8.3).\r\n\r\n**Mist Browser is still beta and we recommend you not to visit untrusted websites for the time being. Ethereum Wallet, though, is OK to use**\r\n\r\n## Note about Linux .deb\r\n\r\nAlthough we still maintain `.zip` files for Linux distros, we are reassessing the support to `.deb` packages, due to some unexpected behaviors. We’re studying the possibility to replace it by AppImage, a self-contained app bundling system that works with many Linux distros. It’s been widely used by modern apps today. Please head to [this thread](https://github.com/ethereum/mist/issues/3767) for more details.\r\n\r\n## CodeTriage\r\nAlthough we’re making great efforts to tackle bugs, enhancements and user requests, the Mist repository gets a lot of support questions. We’re very grateful for the folks who have signed up to receive and triage issues using [CodeTriage](http://codetriage.com/ethereum/mist). This app sends a configurable amount of notifications per day (from 1 to 20) containing issues in need of a response. If you’re interested, this is a great way to help out our team and to learn more about the project.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Checksums\r\n\r\nAs always, you’ll find the checksum table below.
