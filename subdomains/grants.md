# Applying to Ethereum Foundation's grant programs

Projects that receive a Ethereum Foundation grant have no ICO, no token sale, and focus simply on building a useful product or experience.

What we provide for teams that win a grant:
* Non-dilutive funding
* Technical advisory
* Connection to more users
* Platform to share your work

We hope to provide Ethereum teams with more runway, advice and resources to focus simply on building useful products and experiences.

Also, many of these grants may be followed on with additional funding and/or collaboration when milestones are achieved. We believe this will provide tight feedback loops for impact to the ecosystem.


**In future rounds of grants, we would like to see more applications in these areas:**

1. Scalability
   * Alternate sharding implementations
   * Alternate plasma implementations
   * Improving efficiency of existing clients such as geth & parity
   * A tokenless “Lightning Network” for Ethereum

2. Usefulness
   * UX design studies to improve private key management and transacting in Ethereum
   * Alternative wallet / client designs
   * Tooling that improves developer experience
   * Improved documentation & developer/user education videos

3. Security
   * Security audits for Solidity and Vyper
   * Smart contract audits
   * Tooling that prevents vulnerable code

## Individual Hackternships

Ethereum gives out $10,000 for 10 weeks for people who have specific projects in mind. 
Successful projects will be featured at a developer conference.  We are also looking to hire and fund from this pool of side projects.
All hackernship work must be opensource.
Don't forget all accepted applications win a [free t-shirt](https://swag.ethereum.org)!
