## Other ways to help

There are many other ways to help the Ethereum network. If you like meeting people and organizing events, you can set up a [Meetup near you](https://www.meetup.com/topics/ethereum/). If you prefer staying at home, you can volunteer at answering technical questions at our [Stack Exchange](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/) or helping newcomers at [Reddit forum](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum). And you can always help the network by [running a full node client](https://github.com/ethereum/mist/releases) or a [Miner](https://github.com/ethereum/webthree-umbrella/releases/latest) and sharing your statistics at [the network stats dashboard](https://ethstats.net).

But the best way to truly help ethereum adoption is to **go out there and build something awesome!**
